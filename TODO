Bugs (To do list):

Each function must check to see if the radio is in a suitable to mode to 
	execute itself fully (tx has been taken care of, I think).
Check to see if ptt will report high SWR.
CLAR will only toggler CLAR off when in memory mode because the data record
	only returns what is set in memory, NOT the display.
CLAR will not set clarifier offset, don't know why.  Yaesu's fault? 
Test the tuner functions, do not have one.
The vfo tuning should be steppable via the keyboard (arrows even).
Memory saving feature does not work, file opening/closing problems.
There should be a file to parse that has frequencies the user wants
	to scan.
Possibly a "yank freq/mode etc" to be part of a logging database.
Use meter_rd hex output to convert to S meter reading.

And many more to come I am sure.
